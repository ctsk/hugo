  For many years, I was only a casual user of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync">rsync</a> and used it mostly for
  one-off file transfers.

  Over time, I found rsync useful in more and more cases, and would recommend
  every computer user put this great tool into their toolbox ğŸ›  ğŸ§° !
