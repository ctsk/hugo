Back [in 2013, I published a replacement
controller](../2013-03-21-kinesis_custom_controller/) for the Kinesis Advantage
ergonomic keyboard. In the community, it is often referred to simply as the
“stapelberg”, and became quite popular.

Many people like to use the feature-rich [QMK firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/),
which supports my replacement controller out of the box.

On eBay, you can frequently find complete stapelberg kits or even
already-modified Kinesis keyboards including the stapelberg board for sale.

In 2017, Kinesis released the Kinesis Advantage 2, which uses a different
connector (an FPC connector) for connecting the two thumb pad PCBs to the
controller PCB, instead of the soldered cable the older Kinesis Advantage
used. Aside from the change in connector and cable type, the newer keyboard uses
the same pinout as the old one.

I wanted to at least update my project to support the Kinesis Advantage 2. While
doing so, I decided to also make a bunch of improvements to make the project
more approachable and usable for beginners. Among many other improvements, the
project switched from Eagle to [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/), which is FOSS
and means no more costly license fees!

## kinT (T for Teensy!)

I am hereby announcing the [kinT kinesis keyboard
controller](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint): a replacement keyboard
controller for your Kinesis Advantage or Advantage 2 ergonomic keyboards.

The Teensy footprint looks a bit odd, but it’s a combined footprint so that you
can use the same board with many different Teensy microcontrollers, giving you
full flexibility regarding cost and features. See [“Compatibility: which Teensy
to
use?”](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint#compatibility-which-teensy-to-use)
for more details.

I [originally replaced the controller of my Kinesis Advantage to work around a
bug](../2013-03-21-kinesis_custom_controller/), but these days I do most of it
just because I enjoy tinkering with keyboards.

You might consider to replace your keyboard controller for example…

* to build or modify your own keyboard
* to [work around bugs in the standard controller](https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2013-03-21-kinesis_custom_controller/)
* because you prefer to run open source software such as the [QMK firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/), even on your keyboard

## Building your own kinT keyboard controller

1. Follow [“Buying the board and components (Bill of
   materials)”](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint#buying-the-board-and-components-bill-of-materials). When
   ordering from OSH Park (board) and Digi-Key (components), you’ll get the
   minimum quantity of 3 boards for 72 USD (24 USD per board), and one set of
   components for 49 USD.

   * If you have any special requirements regarding which Teensy microcontroller
     to use, this is the step where you would replace the Teensy 3.6 with your
     choice.

1. Wait for the components to arrive. When ordering from big shops like Digi-Key
   or Mouser, this typically takes 2 days to many places in the world.

1. Wait for the boards to arrive. This takes 6 days in the best case when
   ordering from OSH Park with their Super Swift Service option. In general, the
   longer you are willing to wait, the cheaper it is going to get.

1. Follow [the soldering
   guide](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint#soldering). This will take about
   an hour.
   
1. [Install the firmware](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint#installing-the-firmware)

## Improvements over the older replacement board

In case you’re familiar with the older replacement board and are wondering what
changed, here is a complete list:

* The kinT supports both, the older Kinesis Advantage (KB500) **and** the newer
  Kinesis Advantage 2 (KB600) keyboards. They differ in how the thumb pads are
  connected. See the soldering instructions below.

* The kinT is made for the newer Teensy 3.x and 4.x series, which will remain
  widely available for years to come, whereas [the future of the Teensy++ 2.0 is
  not as certain](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensypp.html).

* The kinT is a smaller PCB (4.25 x 3.39 inches, or 108.0 x 86.1 mm), which makes it:

   * more compact: can be inserted/removed without having to unscrew a key well.

   * cheaper: 72 USD for 3 boards at oshpark, instead of 81 USD.

* The kinT silkscreen
  ([front](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kinx-project/kint/44e6c8be96a0e1e13ada5eafdeba8c51a2d6c9e8/pcb-3d-render-front-v2020-06-23.png),
  [back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kinx-project/kint/44e6c8be96a0e1e13ada5eafdeba8c51a2d6c9e8/pcb-3d-render-back-v2020-06-23.png))
  and
  [schematic](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint/blob/44e6c8be96a0e1e13ada5eafdeba8c51a2d6c9e8/schematic-v2020-06-23.pdf)
  are much much clearer, making assembly a breeze.

* The kinT is a good starting point for your own project:

   * kinT was designed in the open source [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/)
     program, meaning you do not need any license subscriptions.

   * The clear silkscreen and schematic make development and debugging easier.

* On the kinT, the Teensy no longer has to be soldered onto the board upside down.

* On the kinT, the FPC connectors have been moved for less strain on the cables.

* The kinT makes possible lower-cost builds: if you don’t need the scroll lock,
  num lock and keypad LEDs, you can use a Teensy LC for merely 11 USD.

## Conclusion

I’m very excited to release this new keyboard controller, and I can’t wait to
see all the custom builds and modifications!

By the way, there is also a (4-hour!) [stream
recording](https://youtu.be/I0kwQbnhlfk) in case you are interested in some more
history and context, and want to see me solder a kinT controller live on stream!
