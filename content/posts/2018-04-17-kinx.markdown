The kinX project is described in a series of blog posts:

* While not strictly a part of this series, [“Hacking your own Kinesis keyboard
controller”](/posts/2013-03-21-kinesis_custom_controller/) describes the first
controller I built in 2013 (maybe interesting for context).

* The [first post introduces the kinX, a keyboard
  controller](/posts/2018-04-17-kinx-keyboard-controller/) with merely 0.33ms of
  input latency (including USB).

* The [second post motivates and describes building a drop-in replacement USB
  hub](/posts/2018-04-17-kinx-usb-hub/) for the Kinesis Advantage keyboard.

* The [last post introduces the processing latency measurement firmware for the
  FRDM-K66F development board](/posts/2018-04-17-kinx-latency-measurement/) and
  draws a conclusion.

You can find the project’s artifacts at https://github.com/kinx-project.
